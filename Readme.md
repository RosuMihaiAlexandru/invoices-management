# Invoices Management

This is a full-stack invoices management application built with Nest.js for the backend and React with Vite for the frontend. The application utilizes Prisma as an ORM for PostgreSQL and runs the database inside a Docker container.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **Nest.js** - A progressive Node.js framework
- **Prisma** - ORM for PostgreSQL
- **Docker** - Containerized PostgreSQL database
- **Jest/Vitest** - For testing

### Frontend:
- **React** - UI framework
- **Vite** - Fast build tool for React

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start PostgreSQL using Docker:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Run database migrations:
   ```sh
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
5. Seed the database with test data:
   ```sh
   npm run seed
   ```
6. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm run start:dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend application:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
